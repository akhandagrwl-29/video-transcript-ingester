hi everyone we are going to be talking about single points of failure now and in a computing context single points of failure are those points where the entire system can crash in case that point crashes so for example let us say you have a database and you have a set of servers if the database crashes then the entire system crashes ok and single points of failure is not a term that computer science has come up with it's there since a very long time if you think about humanity in general we as a service will die out if there's a big enough asteroid which hits earth so if Earth is gone humanity's out that's a single point of failure for us if you think about any story which has a single point of failure then someone is too attached to that character and you cannot afford to kill that character so in a system designer interview single points of failure are an advanced topic if you have lots of services and you have defined how they're going to interact with each other you have made sure that they're meeting all the requirements that's when the interviewer will be interested in testing the resiliency of your architecture so a single point of failure means your architecture is not resilient which means that you have multiple components connected to one point and if this point crashes then your system crashes the obvious and easiest way to mitigate this is to add another node so you had service 1 maybe it was a profile server it used to serve profiles common enough said that everyone is connected to it what you do is you add another profile server which does the same thing and there's two ways to actually set this up one is as a backup in case this crashes you have this node to working but for a service really this is not so useful because what's it going to contain if no one is connected to it on the other hand if this was the database so let's say there's a copy of the database and every change in this database is mirrored on to this database then this is a backup of the data this makes sense backup services don't make much sense because there's a there's a copy of all the data you can say that this database is more resilient than earlier for it to fail now this database has to fail switching order this one and then this has to also feel so probability of that if if one failing was P then the probability has suddenly become P square which is much much smaller now let's try to think of a solution in this general diagram if the client fails that's just one client and you don't care okay in general as far as server if this node fails then our entire service fails so to take care of that you can add another node No and that's the first way of getting reducing a points of failure that is more nose you can word it better but sends the point across anywhere how what this data is in case the database crashes of course we know that fails so it's going to have another database as a replica which is a master/slave architecture right some of these slaves might be read slaves you can read from them some of them may not be in fact maybe you want perfect consistency so that's fine I'm sort of a load balancer to tell you where to send these requests the load balancer itself is a single point of failure so you need multiple load balancers because of this the client may not know which load balancer to connect to so we have to push the climb back over here for the DNS and the client is going to connect to the DNS it needs to have multiple IP addresses resolving for the same host so that is let's say you want you hit facebook.com on your browser any one of these IP addresses is okay if you want to connect to facebook.com and so those are the IP addresses of the load balancers whenever you send a request it comes over here to call it a load balancer only would be a little misleading so it's actually a gateway which is having the load balancing mechanism inin after this is there any other chance that you might have failures yes so like we talked about humanity and earth the entire system if it is located in one place will possibly fail if there's a disaster so in that case what you do look for is regions and multiple regions this of course is mainly after you have taken care of then the process of getting rid of single points of failure through DNS through load balancers through nodes sometimes when you are looking for a distributed sort of read and write in the database you're looking for some sort of coordinator for sure and you get rid of the single point of failure for the coordinator in a very similar way as you got rid of the load balancer I think that gives us a pretty good understanding of what single points of failure are just throw more money at the problem and not just that of course the person who's going to be coordinating or load balancing these these nodes needs to also become resilient so it cannot be a single point of failure and you just keep propagating this all the way till you have made an entire pipeline of distributed system Netflix does this really well what they do is they have something called chaos monkey and they also have other stuff apart from chaos monkey which just randomly goes on production and takes down one node just to make sure that your system is really resilient so really as distributed as you call it so that's something that we can all learn from but for a system design interview well it's easier saying stuff in a system design interview so all you need to do basically is just talk about master slave which is replication you can throw more nodes which is more money I don't know where you want to get it and you're going to have multiple regions if there's a disaster I keep thinking about taking a topic from start to finish but whenever I'm thinking about a solution for a system these kind of topics come up which are very important so you know I'm unable to move forward I really don't know whether I should pick up these smaller topics or actually talk about an entire system but that'll involve these things so let's see I hope I will be able to start with a system hopefully tendo which is next and if you if you want a notification for that or whatever is that I am doing hit the subscribe button I'll see you next time
