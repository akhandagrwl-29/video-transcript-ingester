Hi everyone. We are talking about five do's and
don'ts for system design interviews. Now these tips are very useful if you
have your system design interviews coming up soon or if you're just practicing and
you want the maximum amount from each practice session. Now, the first system design interview
tip that I would like to give you is do not go into detail prematurely. This happens very often when you are
drawing services and databases and you know, clients that are going to be connecting
to these people get into one part of the system and go into very, very
deep detail. For example, if I look at the client and I say
that I'm going be connecting to these services, sometimes
people say that, alright, there's going to be a gateway
here. Is this too much detail? Maybe not, but this is, I'm gonna be using the
HTTP protocol gateway. . What's going to happen with this kind
of a flow is that you are going to be talking all the time, and that's not what
you want in a system design interview. You are gonna be talking for
the majority of the time, but you want the interviewer to
be giving feedback very often. What happens with this is that when
you go into detail and you take a flow, which is not what the interviewer
wants, they won't even stop you. They'll just let you run along.
And once you make the mistake, you'll need to backtrack. And that's
not just wasting time in your interview. That's also a negative point
because in the real world, if you did this and you have to backtrack
that, that would cost money, right? So avoid this point. It's very important that you
do not get into detail until, and unless you're sure or you
have asked that, what should I do? So a good way to actually talk about the
same thing is I'm gonna be talking to all my services using a gateway.
Yeah, this is reasonable. Wait for one second, wait for a response, and then say it's going to be talking
to this service using a protocol. I prefer H G T P because it's widely used, and so the clients don't need to do
something. But again, take that pause. If there's something
important, it'll come up. Maybe the interview will direct you. If you're going to be talking about
databases and they want details, mostly they're gonna be talking about
drawing an entity relation diagram. So you, you'll be
defining your tables well. So that's how you go into detail. You, you wait for some time and you
actually look for the first point which needs detail for the
system to be defined better. Now for the second point, the second point is that don't
have a set architecture in mind. If you have something already
thought out, you know, you have read some blog which says that
this is a really good architecture, maybe MVC maybe event driven,
and you just say that, okay, I'm going to be having this
architecture and I don't care about the requirements, I'm somehow going
to fit the requirements into the, into the system. So if I'm a fan of
publisher subscriber models and I say, there's gonna be a publisher
and subscriber here, which is the only way that services
are going to be talking to each other, maybe it's not the best
for the given scenario. So if you're doing this again, what could happen is the interior
might take it among upon themselves to actually break this architecture
somehow. So the requirements may change. In fact, very often that's,
that's the thing that is done. It's to test your flexibility when you
have something which you feel is really good, and they throw requirements
which are completely different. So don't have a very set
architecture in mind. It happens often when we don't have
time for system design interviews. We are just reading all blog posts and
we see something really good and feel like, yeah, this, this is gonna fit
everywhere. That's not the case. You know, WhatsApp and Uber have very
different architectures. The third one is actually a KISS, which is very famous amongst
programmers. It's keep it simple, stupid. You don't want to pick up one
point of the service and just go on, you know, getting into more
and more detail about this service. Like I'm going to have maybe I'm going to have a heartbeat, which is
gonna be talking to this specifically. I'm also going to be having
another database for analytics for this service. You know,
more and more you get into this specific portion of the architecture,
the more and more narrow your view is. So what I would suggest is
take a step back often enough, just take a step back and have a
look at the entire architecture. Maybe some of the things that you're
doing here, maybe the heartbeat, maybe the analytics can be
extended to the entire system. And very often what happens is if you, if you have a look at the DI
diagram that you're drawing, and if you see one part
of the system, you know, huge  and the other one's all
tiny thin, then it's a good idea. It's a good indicator
that maybe your system, either it needs change or it
needs to become more simplified. You can extract out components from one
part and extend them to the other bits. The fourth point is probably the most
common mistake made in system design interviews, and that is to make
points without justifications. If you have nothing backing up
what you just said, for example, I, I say that the database is going to
be a NoSQL database and I go even more concrete and say it's Cassandra.
One logical question is, why, why do you want
that? And many of us in, in these interviews, we
feel the need to speak. We feel the need to actually make
points continuously because it's, it's awkward. The silence that is between you explaining
and the interviewer evaluating that is very awkward. So you might make
a half-hearted comment on, Hey, I can use Cassandra here. Or you might
feel like, Hey, Cassandra's really cool. So why not just add that to the system?
Be sure about what you're speaking. If this Cassandra database is not
going to be working well here, that's going be a negative point
and that's gonna be against you. So a wide speaking, without
thinking the points through, the final point is to be aware of
current technologies with this. What happens is if you draw a part
of your system, which is for example, the database, you can actually name the technology
you're using in that database. So for example, if I say I'm going
to be using a NoSQL database, and we have already said, Cassandra, you can also use Amazon Dynamo
DB and so on and so forth. What about a relational database,
which is not like a NoSQL database? I can use MySQL, I can use Postgres. Another thing that you might use
for load balancing is elastic load balancer. So you might use the Amazon architecture
to give you this for heartbeats. You might use zookeeper for this
message queue, you might use RabbitMQ, so on and so forth. But me
being aware of these databases, these off the shelf solutions shows that
I'm knowledgeable and I will probably take lesser time and lesser testing
to implement my entire feature. So these are the five important do's and
don'ts for your system Design interview are three pillars that I see our system
design interview standing on are the first one being clarity of thought. So if you can express yourself
clearly to your interviewer, you can do the same with your
teammates. And that's a big plus point. The second one is flexibility. We talked about don't be stuck
with one architecture and you know, roll with the punches. So flexibility is important
when you are designing a system, system design interview. And
the final pillar is knowledge. If you're aware of what's going on around
the world and you're able to design a system successfully, then the system
design interview is a success. So remember the five do's and Don's
that we have discussed over here, and I'll be seeing you next time. That's about actually designing
a system from scratch. So we are gonna be picking up
something and building it from scratch. If you want notifications
